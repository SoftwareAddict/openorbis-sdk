# OpenOrbis - SDK


OpenOrbis Team strives to provide an open source, free, legal SDK for development of the PlayStation 4 console. We will not be providing any interfaces for kernel development. With this being said all of the things that will be included are as follows 

  - Software Development Kit
  - Portable Homebrew/Payload Launcher Source (Currently for 1.76/5.01)
  - Replacement LLVM lld linker for no-prototype/stub generation of source code

# New Features!

  - In order to ease development of userland applications like emulators, media players, and homebrew games, we have included a fully modified LLVM linker to replace the standard. This linker will automatically generate the approperate imports and import id's needed to run using the provided loader (TOOD: Link to source)
  - Faster compile times than other competitve homebrew software development kits

# Peace To:
 - flatz (overall badass)
 - specter (4.05 kernel exploit implementation)
 - mistawes
 - apache
 - hydrogen
 - rebug
